## P10117 - Nice Milk
#### Daniel 'June' Portillo
##### Discription:
    The problem itself is about finding the most optimal method of
covering a piece of bread on its side with milk. N represents the 
number of sides the piece of bread has, h represents how deep the
dish of milk is and k represents the amount dips into the milk
that the bread will take.


## Rundown of Project:

### Original PDF visual

### Visual Examples
This displays an example of the problem with the number of dips(k)
= 2 and the depth(h) = 1 for a simple example of the problem.

### Edge case and Considerations
This represents a more complex case that requires much more
complex considerations in calculating the areas and points
This includs going from the potential of using trapizoids to 
calculate area too...

### Area of a Convex Polygon
...using linear algebra to calculate areas of convex polygons.
Which is necessary for calculating overlaping milked areas and
whenever h is greater than the adjacient line lengths.
